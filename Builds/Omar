Order's Wrath + New Moon Acolyte Synergy

1. Order's Wrath (High Isle - Craftable)

Focus: Critical damage and chance.

Increases Critical Damage and Healing by 8% while providing tons of Critical Chance and Weapon/Spell Damage.

Perfect for maximizing burst damage with heavy attacks, especially since heavy attacks can critically strike.



2. New Moon Acolyte (Southern Elsweyr - Craftable)

Focus: Raw Weapon/Spell Damage.

The massive 481 Weapon and Spell Damage greatly amplifies both heavy attacks and abilities.

The 5% increased cost of abilities is negligible in heavy attack builds because most resources come from the attacks themselves.

How It Fits a Dark Elf Sorcerer

Dark Elf Passives synergize perfectly:

The extra Weapon and Spell Damage from New Moon and Order's Wrath combines with the 258 Weapon/Spell Damage from the Dark Elf passive (Ruination), leading to insane damage scaling.

The Dark Elf's Max Magicka and Stamina bonus (Dynamic) supports sustain for blocking, dodging, and casting utility skills.


Critical Synergy:

Order's Wrath increases critical chance and damage.

Pairing it with Slimecraw's Minor Berserk buff (5% increased damage) ensures heavy attacks hit like a truck.


Elemental Damage Bonus:

The Dark Elf's innate fire damage bonus (15%) will passively buff fire-based skills, like Elemental Weapon or abilities cast with a Flame Staff.

If your friend uses a Shock or Flame Staff, both Order's Wrath and New Moon Acolyte will enhance overall elemental damage.
